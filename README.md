# Climate analysis using sql alchemy
This project is about the climate analysis of a specific area during a specific duration.

## Summary
The project consists of the following:

  *  To perform an analysis of precipitation in the area

  *  To perform an analysis of station data in the area for the past 12 months and plotting the results

  *  Analysis to answer the following question: Hawaii is reputed to enjoy mild weather all year round. Is there a meaningful       difference between the temperatures in June and December?

  *  Analysising the data for a specific timeframe in the previous year to determine whether the weather will be less than ideal.

    *   Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/BharatGuturi/Climate-analysis-using-sql-alchemy.git

    *   Input files are placed in "Resources" folder. It contains measurements and station data in separate csvs for Hawaii.

    *   Run climate.ipynb to get the results of precipitation analysis in the area.

    *   Run app.py to get the results of climate app apis

    *   Run Bonus_1.ipynb to get the temperature results in June and December

    *   Run Bonus_2.ipynb to get the temperature results for a specific timeframe
